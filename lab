Load Balancer
	
lab 6  it already has 2 ec2 instances. (Web server1)

Create an AMI of the application. 
select web server 1== actoins ==> Imahe and template ==> create image
	Name: WebServerAMI==>Image desp==> this is an AMI==>Add a tag, name:WebSeverAmi
	Create a Image
you can view your ami in image section

Now creat a load balancer,before that crate a target groups.
select target groups from load balancing section
	Create target grp
		Target grp name: ELBTargetGroup
		Protocol: http port:80 (Listener process)
		Select Lab VPC (you are telling where are those reoaurces)
		Tag, Name: ELBTargetGroup
		Create Target group

	Create LB
		Name: ELB
		Scheme: Internet facing
		VPC: Lab VPC
		Security groups: Web Security Group
		Listeners and routing
			HTTP:80 : ELBTargetGroup
		Name: Elb
		Create ELB

LB gets a DNS name

Now we have to lauch an Auto Scaling group
First we need to to launch configurations
	Create a launch configuration
		Name: ASGLaunchConf
		AMI:WebSErverAMI
		Instance type: t2.micro
		Monitioring :Detailed Monitoring
		Security Group: Web Security Group
		Key pair: vockey
	Create Launch Configuration

	//Select ASGLaunchCOnfig ==>Action==> Selct auto scaling group
		Name: MyASG
		VPC: Lab VPC
		Selct private subnets (launch your lb in public and Web server in private)
		Load Balancing: attach to an existing lb : ELBTargetGroup
		Health Check: ELB
		Monitioring: Enable CloudWatch
		Group Size:
			Fleet Management	Desired: 2, Min: 2, Max: 6
		Scaling Policies: Target Tracking Sacle policy
			name:
			Metric type: Avg CPU Utilization
			Target Val: 50
			Instance need: 100 seconds (After 100 sec, if CPU_utilzation goes upto 50 for 2 3 times, it will scale up)
			Try Scale in
		Name:MyASG
